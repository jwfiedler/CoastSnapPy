## About
This is an automated version of the original CoastSnap code as written in Matlab.
MATLAB based code for registration and shoreline extraction can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/CoastSnap-Toolbox/tree/master).

It was developped in conjuction with the coastsnap.nl webapplication. It allows users to instantly share and process
a photo taken from a CoastSnap station with our servers from Utrecht University. Automation of shoreline extraction
is based on image registration and object detection. 

## How to run 
This version of CoastSnap was developped using the Spyder IDE. Spyder is a free and open source scientific environment written in Python, for Python, 
and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. This works in conjunction with Anaconda.
In the CoastSnap folder there an environment.yml file can be found. This has to be used in order 
to install the necesarry dependencies for the CoastSnapPy code. 

--step1--
Download the Anaconda platform: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution.
--step2--
Open Spyder through the Anaconda navigator. 
--step3--
Use the "cd" command to acces the CoastSnap directory in the Console.
Initialize the conda evironment running the following command in the Spyder console: "conda env create 
--step4--
Run CSmain.py with the test images form our CoastSnap site Egmond, the Netherlands to see if it is working!
