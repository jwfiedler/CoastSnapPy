## About
This is an automated version of the original CoastSnap code as written in Matlab.
MATLAB based code for registration and shoreline extraction can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/CoastSnap-Toolbox/tree/master).

It was developped in conjuction with the coastsnap.nl webapplication. It allows users to instantly share and process
a photo taken from a CoastSnap station with our servers from Utrecht University. Automation of shoreline extraction
is based on image registration and object detection. 



This is going to be the README!
